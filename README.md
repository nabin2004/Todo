# Django To-Do App

## Overview

Welcome to the Django To-Do App project! This project is designed for educational purposes to help you understand the core concepts of the Django framework. By building a simple To-Do app, you'll gain insights into how Django works, including its templating system and overall architecture.

## Why This Project?

Django is a powerful web framework, and learning it often involves examining existing codebases. However, building a project from scratch provides a clearer understanding of how the components work together. The To-Do app is intentionally kept simple to avoid complexity and to focus on the fundamental aspects of Django.

## Features

- **Create Tasks:** Add new tasks to your to-do list.
- **Update Tasks:** Mark tasks as complete or update their details.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks from your list.
- **View Tasks:** Display all tasks in a user-friendly interface.

## Project Structure

- **`/todo`**: The main app where all the logic for the To-Do application resides.
- **`/templates`**: Directory containing HTML templates for rendering views.
- **`/static`**: Directory for static files like CSS and JavaScript.
- **`manage.py`**: Command-line utility for administrative tasks.
- **`settings.py`**: Configuration file for Django settings.
